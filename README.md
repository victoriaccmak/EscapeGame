# Escape Game

## Project Description

Escape the House is a game written in C# for my final project of the grade 12 computer science course (ISC4U). It earned a 100% in the course. In this game, you try to escape a haunted house by finding a hidden key to escape 5 different rooms.

Using C# with Monogame in Visual Studios, an immersive game was created from scratch. With a stronger focus on programming in the course, the graphics in this game were taken from the internet; however, I've edited them with Pixlr, a photoshop software. Some of the images are drawn by myself using Paint. Using the Monogame Pipeline Tool, these graphics are included into the project.

## How to Install and Run the Game

In order to run the game, Visual Studios 2019 is required. The entire folder, Escape, can be cloned on to your own machine to be run. 

## How to Play

To play the game, the player can start by creating a new profile so that their progress is stored. Press the "New User" button to create a new profile, type in your name, and press "Continue Progress" to start. 

There are five levels. In order to escape each level, the key must be found. It could be hidden under objects. In order to find it, you must pick up objects to reveal a key if it is underneath. Press F to pick up objects.

You are able to hold 5 objects at once. Press D to drop an object from your inventory. You are only able to drop the most recent object that you've picked up similar to a stack.

There are monsters in the level. They are only visible if there are no walls blocking them or if they are in a visible radius. If they come too close, they will start chasing you. You can pick up guns and press SPACE to shoot them. 

Monsters will do damage to your health if they reach you. You can pick up hearts to heal your health. 

Monsters can also go over boxes, folded barricades and chairs, but not through walls or standing barricades. If you drop a barricade from your inventory, it will be standing and protect you from monsters.

This game is not easy. Good Luck and Have Fun!!! 

## Future Improvements

While the game fully functions and all graphics are visually pleasing, the way that the monsters move due to the path searching algorithm is awkward and needs to be fixed. When the monsters are moving in a straight line, they turn to the side briefly, which is not intended.

Furthermore, to make the game more rewarding, badges and special awards can be added to the game. This will make the game more challenging when the player has mastered all the levels.
